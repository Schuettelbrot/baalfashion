# The Designer

I'm Jen  (he/him/she/her) and I'm non-binary and my fashion label Baal is named after Bertolt Brecht's first play, which had a huge impact on me. 

Making clothes makes me really happy and seeing other people content and beautiful in my designs compares to nothing. So here I am. Founded a transpositive fashion label in Berlin in 2013, now living in London. It was only in 2012 when I was introduced to the LGBT community, which feels a bit ironic and sad, as that means I spent too much time thinking I was all wrong in myself.

I love to work with unexpected materials and everything I create works with the "principle of subtle symmetry". It's the second gaze I go for. Did I not get enough attention when I was younger? Yes probably, but if that's what brought me to designing I don't mind it so much. It's interesting how much one needs to create really .. it's in everything. It's in dressing, it's in cooking, it's in working, it's in creating a home. There is so much possibility for expression and creative expression really is life. Creation is life. I think it's the neon green, multi-coloured heart print puffer jacket that my mum made me in the early 90s that introduced me to the power of fashion. Anyway, so thanks to a person at Berlin Pride in 2012 I found my passion and the niche that's perfect for what I want in life and to this day I'm obsessed with the idea of making a third ( or fourth if you include childrens' ) size possible and making the world a better place by creating more happiness.

I studied Fashion Design and graduated to a B.A. at a design school in Berlin, then proceeded to showcase my work at Berlin Fashion Week, Sparkle in the Park Manchester and Pride Week Hamburg. Unfortunately I then went through a very traumatic two years, that put a halt to Baal, but with help I worked myself out of horror and left Berlin.

In London I have since created another collection, spoken at Panels at [Soho House](https://www.sohohouse.com/houses/soho-house-40-greek-street) and the [Institute of Contemporary Art](https://www.ica.art), given interviews for Der Spiegel and Rifemagazine in Bristol, organised Fashion shoots as well as Fashion shows in London, Bristol and Manchester and recently created costumes for the [Royal Birmingham Conservatoire](https://www.bcu.ac.uk/conservatoire).
