Baal is a trans-positive Fashion label, that was founded in 2013 in Berlin, by Jen Hartmann.
It consists of Baal (main line) and a side project in cis-sizes, called QuBaal.

So far three collections have been launched : "Start wearing Purple" in 2013, "Kiss from a rose" in 2014 and "Resurrection" in 2017 and in 2021 Baal ventured back into costume design.                                     

The label is now based in London, UK and works towards a fashion reality, in which Transgender women will not have to compromise on fit and style anymore. The garments are created in our very own size system, which is based on the measurements of real transfemale bodies. 
Designwise, Baal is all about finding artful solutions to the particular challenges of dressing a female mind in a male body.
